# Aria Lang Ecosystem

## Overview

The Aria Lang ecosystem is a collaborative environment for building the next-generation programming language together. This document outlines the structure and purpose of each component.

## Core Philosophy

Aria aims to combine:
- Ruby/Python expressiveness
- Rust/C performance and safety
- Design by Contract principles
- Agent-first development approach
- Modern tooling with LLM assistance

## Ecosystem Structure

### 1. `/aria-web` - Cyberpunk Online Version
The online presence of Aria Lang with a distinctive cyberpunk aesthetic. This is the first entry point for developers to experience Aria.

**Features:**
- Interactive playground (WASM-powered)
- Real-time code execution
- Cyberpunk-themed IDE
- Tutorial system
- Community showcase

### 2. `/contests` - Community Building Challenges

#### Contest #1: Agent Framework Challenge
**Theme:** "Any Language, Agent-First"
- Open to all programming languages
- Focus on agent frameworks, multi-agent systems, and autonomous code
- Showcase how different languages approach agent-based programming
- Build bridges between communities

#### Contest #2: Aria Vision Challenge
**Theme:** "Building What Aria Wants to Achieve"
- Implement features aligned with Aria's goals (contracts, type inference, memory safety)
- Prototype language features
- Tooling and ecosystem contributions
- Research and documentation

### 3. `/community` - Collaboration Hub
- Contributors guide
- Code of conduct
- Meeting notes
- RFCs (Request for Comments)
- Design discussions

### 4. `/examples-showcase` - Real-World Applications
- Production-ready examples
- Cross-language comparisons
- Performance benchmarks
- Best practices

### 5. `/plugins` - Extensibility Layer
- Editor plugins
- Build system integrations
- CI/CD tools
- Language server extensions

## Roadmap Integration

This ecosystem aligns with the PRD v2 phased implementation:
- **Phase 1-2:** Core language and compilation
- **Phase 3:** Safety features and basic tooling
- **Phase 4:** Full ecosystem and package manager
- **Phase 5:** Advanced features and optimization

## Vision

We're building more than a language—we're building a community-driven ecosystem where:
- Agents are first-class citizens
- Safety doesn't compromise expressiveness
- Tooling is delightful
- Contributions are celebrated
- Innovation is encouraged

Join us in building the future of programming.
