## How to Participate in Daily Updates

### As a Participant

#### Share Your Progress
```markdown
**Day 2 Progress Update**

What I built today:
- Implemented message queue for agent communication
- Added 3 test scenarios
- Hit a blocker with serialization

What I learned:
- Message ordering is harder than expected
- Found great library for async messaging

Tomorrow:
- Solve serialization issue
- Add more agent types
- Test under load

Code: [link to repo/commit]
Demo: [screenshot/gif]
```

#### Ask for Help
```markdown
**Need Help: Message Serialization**

I'm trying to serialize agent messages but running into issues with:
- Complex nested data structures
- Custom types

What I've tried:
- JSON (works but limited)
- MessagePack (better but still issues)

Any suggestions? Here's my code: [gist]
```

#### Share Discoveries
```markdown
**Discovery: Agent Lifecycle Pattern**

Found a great pattern for agent lifecycle management:

[code snippet]

This handles:
- Initialization
- State management
- Graceful shutdown

Might be useful for others!
```
