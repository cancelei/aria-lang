# Aria Lang Contests

## Overview

Two concurrent contest tracks designed to build the Aria ecosystem and foster community collaboration.

## Contest #1: Agent Framework Challenge
**Tagline**: "Any Language, Agent-First"

### Objective
Build agent frameworks, multi-agent systems, or autonomous tools in ANY programming language. Show us how your language of choice approaches agent-based programming.

### Why This Matters
Aria is designed with agents as first-class concepts. By seeing how different languages handle agents, we learn what works, what doesn't, and how to make Aria the best platform for agent development.

### Categories

#### 1. Single-Agent Systems
- Autonomous task executors
- Decision-making agents
- Learning agents
- Reactive agents

#### 2. Multi-Agent Systems
- Agent communication protocols
- Distributed problem solving
- Agent coordination
- Emergent behaviors

#### 3. Agent Frameworks
- Agent lifecycle management
- Message passing systems
- Agent discovery and registration
- Monitoring and debugging tools

#### 4. LLM-Powered Agents
- Tool-using agents
- Chain-of-thought agents
- Multi-modal agents
- Self-improving agents

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality** (30%): Does it work as intended?
- **Code Quality** (20%): Is the code well-structured and documented?
- **Innovation** (25%): Novel approaches or unique ideas
- **Agent Design** (25%): How well does it embody agent principles?

- **Organizers post daily**: Challenges, tips, highlights
- **You share progress**: Code, blockers, wins
- **Community helps**: Feedback, solutions, encouragement
- **Everyone learns**: See multiple approaches to same problems

New participants joining mid-week can:
- Read all previous daily updates
- See what others have built
- Learn from the community's progress
- Jump in at any point!

See [DAILY_UPDATES.md](./DAILY_UPDATES.md) for complete guide on how this works.
