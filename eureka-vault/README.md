# Aria Language Research Hub (eureka-vault)

> Where Aria programming language breakthroughs are born

## Vision

Aria is a next-generation programming language combining:
- **Ruby/Python simplicity** - Clean, expressive syntax
- **Rust/C performance** - Zero-cost abstractions, no GC
- **Built-in testability** - Contracts, properties, examples in syntax
- **LLM-assisted optimization** - Verified AI suggestions in compilation
- **Universal targets** - Native, WASM, browser

## Research Methodology

This eureka-vault uses the **Eureka Research Methodology**:

1. **Milestone-Driven** - 20 research milestones covering all aspects of language design
2. **Trigger-Based** - Automated task creation when opportunities/risks identified
3. **Memory-Integrated** - Findings stored as searchable memories
4. **Breakthrough-Focused** - Significant discoveries promoted and documented

## Quick Start

```python
# Start a research session
wedo_continue(scope="aria-lang")

# Check milestone progress
wedo_progress(scope="aria-lang")

# Search existing research
mem_recall(query="type system", scope="aria-lang")
```

## Key Design Decisions

See `docs/decisions/` for architectural decisions and rationale.

## Breakthroughs

Significant discoveries are promoted to `breakthroughs/` directory.

## Integration

This research hub feeds into:
- `GRAMMAR.md` - Formal language specification
- `src/` - Implementation (when ready)
- FlukeBase memories - Cross-project knowledge
