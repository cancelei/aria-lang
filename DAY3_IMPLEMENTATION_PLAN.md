# Day 3 Implementation Plan: "The Hands" - Tools System & Agent Scopes

## Executive Summary

Transform aria-lang from a simple script interpreter into an agentic runtime with:
- Tool definitions with permissions and metadata
- Real agent scopes (not just console output)
- Capability-based security model
- Spawn/delegate primitives for agent orchestration

**Timeline**: Day 3 (Today) - Focus on working prototype. Polish in Days 4-5.
